# Day 1 {#day1 - get data}

Try getting data from repo.

```{r}
library(httr)
# must install RCurl package
df <- read.csv(text = GET("
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cdishop/course_skeleton/master/materials/notes/simple_df.csv                  
                          "), header = T)

```

Now do something with it.
